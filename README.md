## A 500 forms example\.\.\.\.\.\.for instance


</div>

### Description

This is just for expiremental purposes to learn how

to instance a form and then how to free memory of the

form objects after use. It will try to enumerate 500

form objects.

Note: Once you reach your maximum memory stack. The

code will be errorhandled and will tell you how many

forms you can actually instance.

I'll bet that no one can actually get to 500 forms.

(If you instance 500 forms, the MsgBox will not display.)
 
### More Info
 
Maximum number of forms

Assumes you have Visual Basic 5.0 and WinZip. The associated program files are zipped up and need to be unzipped for use.

Visual effects of form instances.

You tell me.
